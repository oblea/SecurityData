# SecurityData
This project will consist of evaluating different classification models to predict malicious and benign website depending on different characteristics that appear within the dataset. The data was found via Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/xwolf12/malicious-and-benign-websites?select=dataset.csv

# Background
Machine learning can aid in solving common tasks such as:

* Regression
  * Task of predicting the next value based on previous values
  * Artificial Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, Neural Turing <achines, Differentiable Neural Computer
* Classification
  * Task of predicting the next value based on previous values
  * Logistic Regression
  * K Nearest Neighbors
  * NaiveBayes
  * DecisionTree Classification
  * Random Forest Classification
* Clustering
  * Similar to classification but the classes are unknown, grouping things by their similarity
  * K Nearest Neighbors
  * K means
  * Bayesian
  
# Research Proposal
Use a data driven approach to find anomalies in data as well as task driven approaches to feed a model with examples of executable files and determing whether the file is malware or not.
